## Introduction

Welcome to my PEP (Personal Exploration and Practice) repository! This is where I document my learning process and showcase the projects I've built while exploring the world of web development.

As a beginner, I've been focusing on mastering the fundamentals of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This repository serves as a testament to my progress and the challenges I've overcome along the way.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've completed so far:

1. **[Project 1: Simple Calculator](./calculator)**: A basic calculator application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
2. **[Project 2: Todo List App](./todo-list)**: A simple todo list application with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.
3. **[Project 3: Weather App](./weather-app)**: A weather application that fetches data from a weather API and displays the current weather conditions.
4. **[Project 4: Tic Tac Toe](./tic-tac-toe)**: A classic Tic Tac Toe game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Feel free to explore the individual project directories to see the code and learn more about each project.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The primary language used for building the functionality of the applications.
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the web pages and creating the user interface.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the web pages and making them visually appealing.
